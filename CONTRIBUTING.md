## Scope

This project is not intended to become a showcase of all atoti's features.
Instead, it should remain zero-config and minimal.
https://docs.atoti.io/ is the right place to discover and learn what atoti can do.

## Checklist

- [ ] Projects should commit their `poetry.lock` to ensure a reproducible environment but it should not be added to this template otherwise projects will start with outdated dependencies (including atoti).
